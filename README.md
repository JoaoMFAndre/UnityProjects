# UnityProjects
Source Code of the various projects and prototypes developed with Unity throughout CTESP Multimedia and Video Games.
Some are still under development, those are the games we have to develop in groups of 4 to submit for evaluation at the end of the 1st semester of the 2nd year.
Inside each folder is a README file with more information about the project.
