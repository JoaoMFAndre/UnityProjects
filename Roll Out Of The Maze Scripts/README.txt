Roll Out Of The Maze is a project that was developed at the end of the first year of the course, in this game the player has to escape a maze, the player controls a ball and has to pick up coins to open the various gates that block the exit while dodging enemies that patrol certain points on the map.
All the scripts were made by me and the game is finished.
