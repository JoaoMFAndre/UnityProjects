Kloven Legacy is a group project which we have to finish by the end of this year, it is an adventure game in which the player controls Aiden a mercenary whose mission is to retrieve the artifacts that are hidden at certain points of a fragmented version of planet earth.
To overcome the many challenges and fights that await him, Aiden will have to resort to his magic glove that uses the power of 5 elements fire, ice, acid, stone and electricity, and these elements can be combined to create certain effects.
Our group consists of 2 3D artists and 2 programmers and the game is not yet complete.
